# A Reconstruction Method for Moments of a Semi-Definte, Periodic, Anisotropc Field
A method for reconstructing the variance (and possibly higher-moments) from a periodic, anistropic semi-definite scalar field.
The aim of this method is to take turbulent fields that have strong magnetic fields in them or in general, when the variance of the
field isn't distributed isotropically in space. This extends the Brunt et. al. (2010a) method to include strong anisotropic features.
